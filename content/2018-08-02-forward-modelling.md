## Spectrum element method

- [SES3D](http://www.cos.ethz.ch//software/production/ses3d.html): SES3D is a program package for the simulation of elastic wave propagation and waveform inversion in a spherical section. The package is based on a spectral-element discretisation of the seismic wave equation combined with adjoint techniques.
