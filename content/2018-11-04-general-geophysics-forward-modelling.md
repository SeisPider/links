## Volcano

- [PF3D](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PF3D): PF3D is a Python module that facilitates volcanic ash dispersal modelling using the FALL3D package

## Geodynamic

- [ASPECT](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect): A parallel, extensible finite element code to simulate convection in both 2D and 3D models.

- [PyLith](https://github.com/geodynamics/pylith): an open-source finite-element code for dynamic and quasistatic simulations of crustal deformation, primarily earthquakes and volcanoes.

- [Rayleigh](https://github.com/geodynamics/Rayleigh): a 3-D convection code designed for the study of dynamo behavior in spherical geometry.

- [citcoms](https://github.com/geodynamics/citcoms): a finite element code designed to solve compressible thermochemical convection problems relevant to Earth s mantle.
