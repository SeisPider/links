## Full waveform inversion

- [lasif](http://lasif.net/prerequisites.html): a data-driven end-to-end workflow tool to perform adjoint full seismic waveform inversions.

- [SeisFlow](https://github.com/rmodrak/seisflows): differs from previous open-source software in emphasizing both flexibility and HPC portability. Examples and usage information are available at readthedocs.org.

## Surface wave inversion

- [topo_sp_cu](http://ciei.colorado.edu/Products/): ray theoretic surface wave tomography code.
