## Structure

### Full Waveform

- [lasif](http://lasif.net/prerequisites.html): a data-driven end-to-end workflow tool to perform adjoint full seismic waveform inversions.

- [SeisFlow](https://github.com/rmodrak/seisflows): differs from previous open-source software in emphasizing both flexibility and HPC portability. 

- [DSM kernel](https://github.com/IPGP/DSM-Kernel): calculate 3D finite frequency Fr√©chet sensitivity kernels (or 3D waveform partial derivatives) for 1D reference Earth models using Direct Solution Method.

### Surface wave

- [topo_sp_cu](http://ciei.colorado.edu/Products/): ray theoretic surface wave tomography code.

- [FMTOMO](http://rses.anu.edu.au/~nick/fmtomo.html): The forward problem of traveltime prediction is solved using a multi-stage fast marching method (FMM), which is a sophisticated grid-based eikonal solver.

### SKS
- [splitlab](https://github.com/IPGP/splitlab): a Matlab based GUI to measure the splitting of (teleseismic) shear waves.

## Source

## Moment tensor
- [MTfit](https://github.com/djpugh/MTfit): a Bayesian forward model inversion code for moment tensor and double-couple source inversion using different data types, based on the Bayesian approach presented in Pugh et al, 2016a and Pugh, 2015.
